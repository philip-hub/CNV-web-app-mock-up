heat maps for x and y for intensity

generate/rendering

don;t worry about techniques dropdown

idea:

stocastic transcribing

we have copy numbers as a transcribing mode and compare it to DNA

compare RNA sequences and whole exon sequences

time series

predefined

and user defined ordering

multi smaple

clustering

single cell heat map with cell


on chromosome plots for multi

add it to where they are all shown you can then click it and it will show a zoomed graph in version of the chromosome for the samples
when you click on it include the comparison for that one chromosome

add an ordering to multisample and get rid of times series page
