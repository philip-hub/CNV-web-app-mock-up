calculate.js Functionality Overview
===================================

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `calculate.js` file, which processes genomic data uploaded by the user and returns the results needed for generating various plots in the CNV (Copy Number Variation) analysis web application.

Overview
--------

The `calculate.js` file is an API route handler in a Next.js application that processes JSON data uploaded by the user. The file performs several calculations to extract and transform the data into a format suitable for plotting. It then sends this data back to the frontend.

### Key Functions and Workflow

### 1\. Request Handling

    export default async function handler(req, res) { ... }

*   **Purpose**: Handles HTTP requests to the API endpoint.
*   **How it works**:
    *   Checks that the request method is `POST`.
    *   Extracts the `filePath` from the request body.
    *   If `filePath` is missing or the method is not `POST`, returns an error response.

### 2\. Reading the File

    const absoluteFilePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'uploads', path.basename(filePath));
    const fileContent = await fs.readFile(absoluteFilePath, 'utf8');

*   **Purpose**: Reads the content of the uploaded file.
*   **How it works**:
    *   Constructs the absolute file path.
    *   Reads the file's content asynchronously.
    *   Parses the content as JSON for further processing.

### 3\. Data Processing and Calculations

The script performs several key calculations and mappings based on the JSON data:

*   **Calculate `lcv0`**: The average `lcv` value for `DIP` clones.
    
        const lcv0 = calculatelcv0(jsonData);
    
*   **Calculate `mavg`**: The average `m` value for `DIP` clones.
    
        const mavg = calculateM0(jsonData);
    
*   **Generate Data for Plots**:
    *   **Plot 1**: Data for coverage plot.
        
            const plotData1 = jsonData.map(group => ({
                x: group.poslcv[i],
                y: group.lcv[i],
                arm: group.arm
            }));
        
    *   **Plot 2**: Data for Vaf plot.
        
            const plotData2 = jsonData.map(group => ({
                x: group.posv[i],
                y: group.v[i],
                arm: group.arm
            }));
        
    *   **Plot 3**: Data for AI vs CN scatter plot.
        
            const plotData3 = jsonData.map(group => ({
                x: group.m,
                y: group.ai,
                arm: group.arm
            }));
        
    *   **Plot 4**: Data for Vaf CDF.
        
            const plotData4 = jsonData.map(group => ({
                x: group.vq[i],
                y: i,
                arm: group.arm
            }));
        
    *   **Plot 5**: Data for Coverage CDF.
        
            const plotData5 = jsonData.map(group => ({
                x: group.lcvq[i],
                y: i,
                arm: group.arm
            }));
        

### 4\. Mapping Values

Several mappings are created to associate arms with their respective values:

*   **Clone Mapping**: Associates each arm with its clone type.
    
        const cloneMapping = jsonData.reduce((acc, group) => { ... });
    
*   **Y3 Mapping**: Maps arms to the scaled `m` values.
    
        const Y3Mapping = jsonData.reduce((acc, group) => { ... });
    
*   **X3 Mapping**: Maps arms to their `AI` values.
    
        const X3Mapping = jsonData.reduce((acc, group) => { ... });
    
*   **S0 Mapping**: Maps arms to their `S0` values.
    
        const s0Mapping = jsonData.reduce((acc, group) => { ... });
    

### 5\. Sending the Response

    res.status(200).json({
        plotData1, uniqueArm1Values,
        plotData2, uniqueArm2Values,
        plotData3, uniqueArm3Values,
        plotData4, uniqueArm4Values,
        plotData5, uniqueArm5Values, aiValues,
        mValues, arm6Values,
        arm7ColorMapping, cloneMapping,
        Y3Mapping, X3Mapping,
        mMapping, dmMapping, dcnMapping, 
        lcv0, mavg, lcvMapping, s0Mapping, 
        startMMapping, middleMMapping, endMMapping
    });

*   **Purpose**: Sends the processed data back to the client.
*   **Data Included**:
    *   `plotData1` to `plotData5`: Data for the various plots.
    *   `aiValues`, `mValues`: Calculated `AI` and `m` values.
    *   `arm7ColorMapping`: Mapping of arms to their corresponding colors based on the clone type.
    *   `cloneMapping`, `Y3Mapping`, `X3Mapping`: Various mappings for the plots.
    *   `lcv0`, `mavg`: Calculated averages for LCV and `m`.
    *   `s0Mapping`, `startMMapping`, `middleMMapping`, `endMMapping`: Mappings related to the genomic coordinates.

Conclusion
----------

The `calculate.js` file processes genomic data to generate several plot datasets and mappings. It performs essential calculations like `lcv0` and `mavg`, and it sends back a structured JSON response with all necessary data for rendering the plots in the frontend.
